## Toby Muir-Little

Before becoming a developer I was a sales professional with an Economics degree. I'm used to working under pressure and in fast paced environments. The moment I started looking into coding I fell in love with it.

Having finished a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp (Makers Academy,) I've learnt so much in such a short amount of time - and I have a serious hunger to learn more. I have learnt not only technologies (Node, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB among a few) I have also learnt to work by the XP principles, follow test driven development and how to learn efficiently.

I've always been the person who fixes problems at my previous jobs be it a vlookup in excel or a computer not turning on. I've always wanted to work with computers but was never given the chance to grow this until now.

## Skills

#### Enjoy Learning in depth

I love nothing more than learning new things. In my previous sales career I was always the first to jump onto a new product and learn the ins and outs before talking to clients about it. This helped me a lot in my career as people want to speak to someone knowledgeable when buying from someone.

In terms of my time as a developer, this has manifested in the drive to learn as much as I can about a technology while using it. I hesitated to write a line of code without understanding as much as I can about it beforehand. This gave me the ability to solve problems efficiently when the inevitable wall of red text appeared.


#### Fast Learner

I am able to pick up new skills and learn quickly, I play guitar, ski, snowboard. In my previous career my ability to learn quickly landed me as the AV specialist in the company. In order to sell a certain product someone in the company had to take an exam and I took it upon myself to learn about it in depth, and quickly, and passed.

In my time at Makers, this has helped as every week we have had a new subject, or technology to learn. I have learnt not only how to program, but also how to learn a new language. This gives me the ability to pick up any new technology or language incredibly quickly and efficiently.

#### Problem Solver

I've always enjoyed numbers, puzzles, games and challenges. As an account manager I was always solving issues for my client for a multitude of reasons. I was always praised for my ability to help the client in an efficient and professional manner.

Problem solving has been an essential skill while learning to program. Any time there was an issue or bug in my projects I was the first port of call once google had been exhausted. I am extremely focused when there is a problem at hand and won't rest until it has been resolved. One particular instance of this was testing during the final project. Using Zombie with Javascript's asynchronous nature was an amazing learning experience!

#### Personable

I love meeting new people and get on with people with all sorts of personalities. This was extremely helpful while being an account manager as my clients were all completely different people. In my professional life I've relished working in teams and love being a positive energy in a group.

During Makers I have worked with so many different people and made some amazing friends. I got to work in great teams and have greatly enjoyed pair programming.
