#### Former IT Hardware Salesperson turned Full Stack developer

I have worked in a sales environment for the last 4 years. It was great and taught me some invaluable lessons (bulleted below), but I have always dreamt of a career where I can hone a real skill, a skill that I am passionate about.

Looking back on the last 16 weeks at Makers Academy, the amount I've learnt is incredible. I've gone from knowing nothing about programming to utilising TDD and Pairing to write clean, maintainable code for projects I'm truly proud of.

I can't wait for the next step. The opportunity to work with amazing people, learn even more and be of real value to a company is truly exciting for me. I have never been happier, I know how to pick up a new technology, and I look forward to becoming the best programmer I possibly can be.

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

I've always relished being part of a team and thrive when working with other people. Pairing and Group work have been a part of programming I really care about. I've never had a moment where I couldn't work with someone, be it needing to slow down and really explain an idea to someone, or listening and understanding what my partner has to teach me - especially when experiencing javascript for the first time.
- Understanding and extracting the true needs of clients through listening and asking the right questions.
- Learning how to develop relationships with new and existing (80) clients.
- Working in sales teams of 4-6, supporting and looking out for each other.

#### Learning Efficiently

At Makers, each week we effectively had to start again with a new technology or idea. We completed our final project in node which I had never used before. I have not just learnt how to program, but also how to pick up a new language and add value to my team in a short space of time.
- Appointed Audio-Visual (AV) Product Specialist.
- AV Product Accreditation. I was the first and only person in the company to complete an exam to allow them to sell a certain line of products. I enjoyed it!
- A multitude of hobbies including drums, guitar, skiing, snowboarding and flying my mini-drone.

#### Need to Understand

I want to learn as much as I can about a technology while working with it. I hesitate to implement a line of code without knowing what it does. This came in useful when delving into socket.io for the first time, and to my ability to solve problems efficiently when a wall of red text appeared.
- Went the extra mile to understand the technology of the products I was selling to best advise my clients.
- Became the go to expert on other product lines in my team and for clients (Servers, Computers and unfortunately Printers...)

#### Problem Solving

Any time there was an issue in our projects I was usually called in. I love fixing a bug. I am extremely focused when there is a problem at hand and won't rest until it has been resolved. Using Zombie to test our node application with Javascript's asynchronous nature was brutal but rewarding!
- Fixing computer/excel related problems with colleagues!
- Guiding clients through unique AV solutions over the phone who knew little about the subject.
- Pragmatically working with clients to resolve issues, be it credit related or an urgent missed delivery.
