#### Former IT Hardware Salesperson turned Full Stack developer

Working in a sales environment for 4 years has been great and has taught me some invaluable lessons (bulleted below), but I have always dreamt of a career where I can hone a real skill, a skill that I am passionate about.

Looking back on the last 16 weeks at Makers Academy, the amount I've learnt is incredible. I've gone from knowing nothing about programming to building a full stack application in 10 days that I'm truly proud of, having barely been exposed to the technologies used at all. (Node, MongoDB, Zombie.)

I can't wait for the next step. The opportunity to learn more and be of real value to a company is truly exciting for me. I've learnt the basics, I've learnt how to learn, and now I look forward to becoming the best programmer I possibly can be.

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

I've always relished being part of a team. I love working with other people. Pair programming and Group Projects have been areas of programming that I really enjoy. I've never had a moment where I couldn't work with someone while programming, be it needing to slow down and really explain an idea to someone, or fully listening and understanding what my pair was guiding me through.
- Understanding and extracting the true needs of clients through listening and questions.
- Learning how to develop relationships with new and existing clients.
- Working in sales teams of 4-6, supporting and looking out for each other.

#### Thirst for Learning

I want to learn as much as I can about a technology while using it. I hesitate to write a line of code without understanding it. This gave me the ability to solve problems more efficiently when a wall of red text appeared.
- I didn't want to be another 'box shifter'. I wanted to inform and help my clients where possible so I learnt about the products in depth.
- Appointed Audio-Visual (AV) Product Specialist.
- A multitude of hobbies including drums, guitar, skiing, snowboarding and flying my mini-drone.

#### Learning efficiently

Every week we were given a new subject, or technology to learn. I have learnt not only how to program, but also how to actually learn a new language. This gives me the ability to pick up any new technology or language incredibly quickly and efficiently.
- Fastest to understand the world of HP server hardware solutions in order to sell them efficiently.
- AV Product Accreditation. I was the first and only person in the company to complete an exam to allow them to sell a certain line of products. I enjoyed it!

#### Problem Solving

Any time there was an issue in our projects I was usually called in. I love fixing a bug. I am extremely focused when there is a problem at hand and won't rest until it has been resolved. Using Zombie to test our node application with Javascript's asynchronous nature was an amazing learning experience!
- Fixing computer/excel related problems with colleagues!
- Guiding clients through AV requirements over the phone who knew little about the subject.
- Pragmatically working with clients to resolve issues, be it credit related or even an urgent missed delivery.
